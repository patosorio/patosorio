## Featured Projects

### [Bookings App](https://github.com/patosorio/Artist-bookings)

Full-stack project to manage bookings for an artist agency.  

This app includes multi-tenancy support, allowing different agencies to manage their own data in isolation. The challenge was designing a scalable backend that keeps each tenant’s users, bookings, and artist data separate while using shared infrastructure. I implemented this with a clean Django architecture that organizes models and routes per tenant context.

- **Frontend**: Built with Next.js using Vercel’s `v0` AI-powered generator  
- **Backend**: Django REST Framework  
- **Hosting**: Frontend on Vercel, Backend on Google Cloud Run  
- **Authentication**: Firebase Authentication  
- **Storage**: Firebase Storage  
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (Cloud SQL)

### [Home Expenses App (Next.js)](https://github.com/patosorio/home-expenses-nextjs)

**Repository:** [Home Expenses App (Next.js)](https://github.com/patosorio/home-expenses-nextjs)

Experimental app to track household expenses using only frontend tools and Firebase services.

This project explores how far you can go with a frontend-only stack by relying on Vercel’s `v0` AI-generated Next.js code. No custom backend is used — all data handling and authentication are managed through Firebase, making it fast to build and easy to deploy.
